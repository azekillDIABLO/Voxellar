[Industrial Diamonds]

# Industrial diamond grit output.
#
# By default when creating industrial diamond grit the output will
# be 8 pieces. This is more than enough for creating industrial
# diamonds. Consider lowering the value to 4 for not being too
# imbalanced. Diamonds should stay worthy!

# Amount of raw industial diamonds from crafting.
#
# By default you get 4 raw industrial diamonds from crafting them
# with the needed materials. If you want to keep diamonds worthy
# lower the value to 2. But I think 4 is a good value.

# crystals. With 8 you already get a good amount of it ...

# make this even more imbalanced.
