# Creating industrial diamonds

Diamonds are highly compressed carbon and therefore could be created by compressing coal in real life. With this mod it is possible to craft an “Industrial Diamond”. It can be crafted in the following way:

1. Craft compressed coal block from 3×3 coal blocks
2. Craft industrial diamond grit using a checker pattern from compressed coal blocks and any type of sand starting with a compressed coal block in the top left of the crafting field
3. Craft raw industrial diamonds from 2×2 industrial diamond grit
4. Smelt raw industrial diamonds to get regular industrial diamonds


# Create Mese crystals through molding

Molding a Mese crystal is divided into several steps. It will cost you some Mese Crystals to start with and you will get a few more Mese crystals when finished.

1. You need a **Mold** to create molded Mese crystals. The mold is crafted from four iron ingots in a rhomb shape. A mold gets destroyed when molding a Mese crystal.
2. **Mese Powder** is one of the two bases you need to create the raw material for molding. Mese powder can be created by putting one single *Mese Crystal Fragment* into the crafting grid.
3. A **Cutting Agent** will be used to stretch the Mese powder. The recipe is a bit more complicated to keep xIndustrial compatible with as much mods as possible. First row: `C, E, C`, second row: `E, E, E`, third row: `C,E,E`. Where `C` is cobblestone and `E` is empty space.
4. **Combine** the *Mese Powder*, the *Cutting Agent* and *water* (a water filled bucket) in the crafting grid in a shapeless recipe to get the raw material (*Wet Impured Mese Powder*) for molding a Mese Crystal.
5. The **Mold** and the **Wet Impured Mese Powder** in a shapeless recipe to mold a raw Mese crystal.
6. **Cook** the *Wet Molded Mese Crystal* into a *Molded Mese Crystal*.

It is not possible to use the molded Mese crystals like regular Mese crystals. You can craft some stuff from it but you can’t use them to create more molded Mese crystals :)


## Additional stuff created with Mese

I decided to add some recipes from other mods since they use Mese, too. Feel free to suggest some more make sure that you can’t craft it into a regular Mese crystal again since this would result in unlimited Mese *g*


### Mesecons

1. Create Mesecon wires from molded Mese crystals
