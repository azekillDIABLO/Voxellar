Add charcoal and a compressed coal block to Minetest.

The mod does not add custom textures and thus integrates very well into all texture packs. Since nothing in this mod is texture size dependent it works will texture packs of all sizes.

All values mentioned are sane default values but can be changed through the mod's advanced configuration options.

# Charcoal
Charcoal is created by cooking a tree trunk. After four seconds four pieces of charcoal are created using one tree trunk.

A piece of charcoal can be used to craft four torches (they are the default torches) or for fueling the oven for 60 seconds like with regular coal. It can be used for crafting a coal block, too.

# Compressed coal block
One compressed coal block can be created by putting nine coal blocks into the crafting grid like you create one coal block from nine pieces of coal.

A compressed coal block can be used as decoration of for fueling the oven for 4000 seconds.
