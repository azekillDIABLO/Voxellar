[Charcoal]

# The amount of charcoal returned from cooking one piece of wood.
#
# By default the value is 4 which should be enough to be worthy but
# not too much to be too imbalanced.
xcoal_charcoal_output (Amount of charcoal from cooking) int 4

# The time it takes to cook one piece of charcoal.
xcoal_charcoal_cooktime (Duration for cooking) int 4

# The duration one single charcloal pieces fuels the oven for.
#
# By default this is 60 units. According to the Minetest Wiki this
# is the same amount of units a regular lump of coal lasts.
xcoal_charcoal_burntime (Burn time) int 60

# Amount of torches created from one piece of charcoal
#
# When crafting torches from the default mod you get four torches
# from one piece of coal and a stick. Charcoal torches (actually
# the mod creates default torches from charcoal) should stay at
# the same amount to mmaintain consistency.
xcoal_charcoal_torches_output (Charcoal torches output) int 4


[Compressed Coal Block]

# The burn time of one compressed coal block.
#
# A regular coal block fuels the oven for 370 units. A compressed
# coal block is made of 9 regular coal blocks and therefore lasts
# for 3330 units. But ... Because it is compressed it lasts for
# some more units because it burns slower. By default 4000 units.
xcoal_compressed_coalblock_burntime (Burn time) int 4000

# Amount of compressed coal blocks returned from crafting.
# 
# By default 9 coal are used to create one coal block. This mod
# takes by default 9 coal blocks for crafting 1 compressed coal
# block which makes absolute sense. If you want to change that
# alter this value to whatever zou want
xcoal_compressed_coalblock_crafting_yield (Crafting yield) int 1

# Amount of coal blocks returned when uncrafting.
#
# When “uncrafting” a compressed coal block a defined amount of
# regular coal blocks are returned. This value should stay at or
# lower than 9, otherwise unlimited coal blocks can be created
# from one compressed coal block.
xcoal_compressed_coalblock_uncraft_yield (Uncraft yield) int 9
