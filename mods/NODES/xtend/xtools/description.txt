Create tools from the artificial crystals and diamonds.

It is possible to craft all default tools including the diamond hoe from industrial diamonds (from xIndustrial) with the known tool recipes using industrial diamonds. The results are the default diamond tools.

Since it is not possible to create farming:cotton from default:wool but it is possible to create default:wool from farming:cotton I decided to fill that gap. With xTools it is possible to create farming:cotton from group:wool.
