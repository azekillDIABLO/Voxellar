Create unlimited sources of various liquids.

Ever wanted to create an unlimited lava source but learned very soon that it is not possible like it is with water? Me too. So I created a brazier holding some lava and acting as unlimited lava source.

But that was not enough. So for the sake of evolving and expanding there are now various vessels holding various liquids and being easily extendable.

The recipe is always the same in shape.

Where `T` is a defined top material and `F` used for the foots (legs) of the vessel and `B` being a bucket of the liquid you want to store in the vessel. Not all vessels support all liquids. While the burning hot lava needs obsidian to be stored water is best stored in a wooden trough. Consult your craft guide for details.

**Attention server owners**: xVessels is pretty much unbalanced on purpose. You can store liquids otherwise not easily obtainable or being very limited in a convenient place providing an unlimited amount of that liquid.

**Attention players**: Read the message to server owners. This applies to your playing experience, too :)
