[Object properties]

# Amount of objects returned from crafting
#
# Crafting is quite easy and usually needs only 3 to 5 nodes so
# returning 4 objects is fair.
xfurniture_crafting_yield (Crafting yield) int 4

# When uncrafting an object it’s base nodes are returned.
#
# Most recipes require 3 to 5 nodes to return the default of 4
# objects. So returning one node for one object is a good value.
xfurniture_uncraft_yield (Uncraft yield) int 1

# Transfer base nodes’ light_source value to the object
#
# Some base nodes have a light_source value set so they emit
# light of a defined level. By default the objects crafted from
# said nodes will have the same light_source value set. Set
# to false if you don’t want that.
#
# Please note that already placed nodes are not affected by
# that value. You need to update the lighting of the block
# where the node is placed in.
xfurniture_use_light_source (Use light_source value) bool true

# Optical indent for placing window stuff
#
# If you use vertical slabs or one of the moreblocks "cutted
# blocks" from the circular saw as walls for your buildings
# you might want to place window stuff there, too.
#
# This setting allows you to do that. 0 is the default and
# does not change anything. Every other number is an 16th
# fraction of the node. The stuff gets set back by that
# fraction.
#
# For example: If you use slabs as walls, you weant to set
# this value to 8, because the nodebox of a slabs is half the
# size of a regular node.
xfurniture_window_stuff_indent (Optical indent for window stuff) int 0 0 16


[Mod configuration]

# Hide objects from craftguide/creative inventory/etc.
#
# Because there are a lot of nodes created by xFurniture (a lot
# of objects each created with all supported nodes) special
# inventories would be cluttered with hundreds and hundreds of
# xFurniture objects.
#
# For not overloading those special inventories (craftguides,
# creative inventories, and so on) this option allows to hide
# all of the xfurniture objects from those inventories if it is
# supported by the particular inventory.
xfurniture_hide_objects (Hide objects from special inventories) bool false

# Define what objects to register
#
# Maybe not all users want to have all of the objects to be
# registered. You might like the window stuff being added but
# do not care about the other stuff? Just set the flags as
# you like them.
# 
# Please note that the special value “all” is not re-settable
# once changed to one or more of the possible flags, you need
# to restore the default of this configuration option.
xfurniture_objects_to_register (Objects to register) flags all chairs,tables,window_stuff,benches,couches,stairs_slabs,walls,temporary_solutions

# Regex-based node blacklist
#
# The blacklist defines what nodes out of all the supported
# and loaded mods are not to be used. The list gets separated
# by a space, a number sign, and another space (that is the
# string “ # ” sans quotes).
#
# Each “section” represents one regular expression defining
# a filter that will be applied when loading the nodes and
# thus makes it possible to ignore some nodes.
#
# For example if you want to ignore all nodes from the
# `default` mod that are dirt with something applied you
# use the following.
#
#    default:dirt_with_.*
#
# When you want to ignore this and all stones with stuff
# in them (i.e. the ores) you use this:
#
#    default:dirt_with_.* # default:stone_with_.*
#
# But this could be generalized and combined to this:
#
#    default:%w+_with_.*
#
# This will match all default:whatever_with_... nodes.
#
# See <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.4.1> for
# a definition of Lua regex patterns.
#
# Hint: The less different entries you make here the
# faster the mod will load.
xfurniture_blacklist (Node blacklist) string


# Additional nodes to use
#
# This is a space-separated list of node IDs from nodes
# you want to add in addition to the already loaded
# nodes from the supported mods.
#
# Make sure that the mods are already loaded before
# xFurniture loads. This can be granted for `default`
# only and has to be seen as unreliable as long as
# xFurniture does not (opt-)depent on that mod.
#
# Better open an issue at GitHub.
xfurniture_additional_nodes (Additional nodes) string
