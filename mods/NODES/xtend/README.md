This modpack adds different things to Minetest.

# Overview
The xTend modpack is a collection of my xTend mods. It initially started as a nameless mod to add charcoal and quickly became a modpack, and a mod again, and a modpack again â€¦

All xTend mods use as less custom textures as possible to maintain the look and feel of the user-selected texture pack. In addition to that almost all options are configurable through `Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Mods -> [name of the mod]`.

# Installation
Method 1: Simply `git clone` this modpack into your `mods` sub directory within the Minetest directory. In the client simply enable the modpack as a whole.

Method 2: If you don't want to load the whole modpack just load the mods you want. Here you can load the individual mods in the latest available version using [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit)

* [xCoal](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/4w/xtend/tree/master/xcoal)
* [xFurniture](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/4w/xtend/tree/master/xfurniture)
* [xIndustrial](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/4w/xtend/tree/master/xindustrial)

* [xTools](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/4w/xtend/tree/master/xtools)

All of the mods depend on [xtend_default](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/4w/xtend/tree/master/xtend_default). So you need to load and enable it, too, in order to use the other mods.
